There are two modes can be select by the keys
Mode1: music player. Keys are used for selecting working mode and a sepecific music which is saved into FPGA before. All the information will show and LCD, including the name of the music and the music note. The buzzer works after selection.

Mode2: mini piano.  Rotary encoder is used for playing piano because of limited resources. VGA is used for the simulation of playing a piano. A picture of piano is showed on the screen and a rectangular under it shows which key on the piano is pressed. The buzzer would produce the corresponding sounds.
